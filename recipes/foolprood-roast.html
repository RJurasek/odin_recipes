        <h2>What Is a Standing Rib Roast?</h2>
        <p>A standing rib roast, also known as a prime rib roast, is a cut of beef from the primal rib. It's called a standing rib roast because it's usually 
            cooked "standing" on the bones (so that the meat doesn't touch the pan).</p>
        <p>Prime rib is generally considered a superior cut of beef: It's tender, juicy, and wonderfully flavorful.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (5 pound) beef standing rib roast, at room-temperature (let sit out for 1 hour before starting recipe)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        </ul>
