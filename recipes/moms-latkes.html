        <h1>Mom's Potato Latkes</h1>

        <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah,
             but are really wonderful any time of the year! This 
             is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best 
             potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a 
             second batch because they disappear so quickly. 
             I've tried other recipes and always return to this 
             one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
